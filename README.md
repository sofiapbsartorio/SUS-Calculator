# SUS (System Usability Scale) Calculator

### The System Usability Scale (SUS) is a widely-used tool developed by John Brooke in 1986 to quickly measure the usability of systems. It consists of a simple, ten-item questionnaire with alternating positive and negative statements that respondents rate on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from "Strongly Disagree" to "Strongly Agree." The SUS score is calculated by adjusting responses: odd-numbered items are scored by subtracting 1 from the response, while even-numbered items are scored by subtracting the response from 5. The adjusted scores are then summed and multiplied by 2.5 to yield a total score between 0 and 100. 

### This code was developed for my thesis project to calculate the SUS (System Usability Scale) score based on participant responses.
